Absolutely! That's a much better approach - **incremental development with testing at each step**. This is how real distributed systems are built. Let me update the game plan to follow this **test-driven, incremental approach**.

# 🎯 **Updated Game Plan: Incremental Development with Testing**

## **🔄 Development Philosophy**
**Build → Test → Integrate → Repeat**

For each task:
1. **Implement** the smallest possible unit
2. **Write tests** to verify it works
3. **Integrate** into the running system
4. **Test end-to-end** that the system still works
5. **Move to next task**

This ensures we always have a **working system** that gets progressively more capable.

3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the complete system still works
4. **Manual Testing**: Run the system and verify behavior

### **Test Categories:**
- **Functionality Tests**: Does it do what it's supposed to do?
- **Error Handling Tests**: Does it handle errors gracefully?
- **Performance Tests**: Does it perform adequately?
- **Fault Tolerance Tests**: Does it handle failures?

### **Testing Tools:**
- **pytest** for unit tests
- **Manual testing** with cluster scripts
- **Fault injection** (kill nodes, network issues)
- **Load testing** with multiple clients

## ** Key Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Always Working System**: At each step, you have a working system
2. **Incremental Learning**: You learn each concept as you implement it
3. **Easy Debugging**: Problems are isolated to the current task
4. **Confidence Building**: Each success builds confidence for the next task
5. **Realistic Development**: This is how real systems are built

## **🚀 Getting Started**

**Start with Task 0.1** - Project Setup & Dependencies. This gives you a solid foundation to build on.

Each task should take **30 minutes to 2 hours** to complete, test, and integrate.

Would you like me to start with Task 0.1 and help you set up the project dependencies and basic structure?
